          We are second-hand people. We have lived on what we have been told,
          either guided by our inclinations, our tendencies, or compelled to
          accept by circumstances and environment. We are the result of all
          kinds of influences, and there is nothing new in us, nothing that we
          have discovered for ourselves: nothing original, pristine, clear.

            Feeling important makes one heavy, clumsy and vain. To be a warrior
            one needs to be light and fluid. Self-importance requires spending
            most of one's life offended by something or someone.

            In a world where death is the hunter, my friend, there is no time
            for regrets or doubts. There is only time for decisions.

            The trick is in what one emphasizes. We either make ourselves
            miserable, or we make ourselves happy. The amount of work is the
            same. The ego is like a tired old dog. We can never kill it, so put
            it out on the back porch, let it rest there, and step around it.

      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        Freedom is not a reaction; freedom is not choice. It is manâ€™s pretence
        that because he has choice he is free. Freedom is pure observation
        without direction, without fear of punishment and reward. Freedom is
        without motive; freedom is not at the end of the evolution of man but
        lies in the first step of his existence. In observation one begins to
        discover the lack of freedom. Freedom is found in the choiceless
        awareness of our daily existence and activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discipline, as understood by a warrior, is creative, open, and produces
        freedom. It is the ability to face the unknown, transforming the feeling
        of knowing into reverent astonishment; of considering things that exceed
        the scope of our habits, and daring to face the only war that is
        worthwhile: The battle for awareness.
